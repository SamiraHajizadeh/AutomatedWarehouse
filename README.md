# Automated Warehouse
This project simulates an automated warehouse using ladder programming in TIA Portal and simulating in FactoryIO. 

## Overview
The project uses ladder programming to automate the warehouse's conveyor belts, sensors, and robots. The program receives data from sensors and uses it to control the conveyor belts and robots to transport items from one location to another. The program is designed to optimize the warehouse's efficiency, reduce errors, and minimize downtime.

Automated warehouses are becoming increasingly popular in industries such as logistics, manufacturing, and e-commerce. They use a combination of hardware and software to automate various tasks, such as item storage, retrieval, and transport. Automated warehouses offer many benefits over traditional manual warehouses, including increased efficiency, reduced labor costs, and improved safety.

The simulation is done in FactoryIO, where the program is tested and debugged. The simulation includes various warehouse scenarios, such as item storage, retrieval, and transport.

## Dependencies
TIA Portal
FactoryIO
Knowedge in Ladder Programming

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open TIA Portal and import the project files from the repository.
Open FactoryIO and load the warehouse simulation.
Run the program in TIA Portal and start the simulation in FactoryIO.

## Usage
Once the program and simulation are running, you can use the GUI to monitor the warehouse's status and performance. The GUI shows real-time data about the conveyor belts, sensors, and robots, as well as any errors or issues that may arise.

You can also modify the program and simulation to test different scenarios and configurations. The program and simulation are designed to be modular and flexible, allowing for easy customization and expansion.

Here's a short GIF showing the output of the warehouse simulation:
